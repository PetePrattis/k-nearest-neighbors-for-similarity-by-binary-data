# A Java Program / Project

**This is a java project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for my thesis project
and is a test program implementing knn algorithm to use as a template for my thesis project_

> #### Description of project
>
>>A Java console application that implements the factionality of the knn algorithm to find the similarity between a new user's location preferences and the locations. The binary data (0,1) are the location characteristics.

> #### Impementation of project
>
> 1. Implementing knn algorithm using these heuristics for similarity score:
>> - Cosine similarity
>> - Hamming distance
>> - Euclidean distance 
>> - Manhattan distance
>

> #### About this project
>
> - This is a test project and an effort to implement the knn algorithm using a variety of heuristics for similarity score
> - The comments to make the code understandable, are within the .java archive
> - This project was written in Eclipse Java IDE
> - This repository was created to show the variety of the work I did and experience I gained as a student
